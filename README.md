# Cookies 
#### My concept: 

My idea for this exam is to write a paper about http cookies. 

#### The problems I want to address 
With this paper, I want to examine in what way different web pages uses cookies, and what they gain from the use of these. Furthermore, I want to look into how much information they provide the user with, and if this information is clear enough for the user. Do they really know what are saying yes to, when accepting these cookies? 

##### Some questions: 
-	What exactly are cookies? 
-	Why are websites using cookies in the first place? 
-	How do they use this information?
-	Do they provide the user with enough information about the cookies? 
-	Why are cookies even necessary? 
-	Who has access to the data? 
-	How does cookies influence the users experience on the internet? 
-	Can cookies be used as a way to control the user’s behavior on the internet? 

Also, I think it could be really interesting to examine cookies as a potential problem. 
As cookies is a big part of our internet experience, and they gain a lot of information about the user’s behavior, I think it could be interesting to look at these in a critical way. Can it create some kind of problems for the user when the websites can use their data as they like? 

I think this topic is important, because the internet and the digital culture is having a big impact on our everyday lives, and this impact is only getting bigger and bigger.

#### Next steps: 
The next steps in my process is to read all my sources thoroughly through, and select the point of views and quotes that I want to elaborate on in my paper. I am also going to search for more sources to include in my process. After this, I will try to create a draft where I structure the different subjects I want to write about in my paper. I want to give these some headlines, so I have a draft of the outlining of my paper.
